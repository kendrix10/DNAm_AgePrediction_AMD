This repository describes the pre-processing and analysis steps done in uncovering the predictive power of the DNA methylome to discover the underlying epigenetic relations that may contribute to the age acceleration seen in age-related diseases such as AMD (age-related macular degeneration).

The analysis was completed using publicly available AMD dataset available on ArrayExpress with accession [E-MTAB-7183](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-7183?query=E-MTAB-7183). I used several epigenetic age predictive algorithm that were developed using the 450K and 850K arrays including the gold-standard [Horvath epigenetic clock](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0004-3), [Skin & Blood clock](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075434/), [Cortical clock](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7805794/), [Zhang mortality clock](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14617), [Hannum epigenetic clock](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276512008933), [Weidner epigenetic clock](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r24), and [PhenoAge clock](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5940111/). 

This analysis presents as the first attempt in benchmarking the different epigenetic clocks against each other and testing the predictive ability of the clocks beyond the tissues that were initially used to develop the clocks. The anticipated outcome of this analysis is to hopefully uncover the wide-usability of these clocks to apply to different tissue types and to correlate the underlying age-related biomarkers to the age-related diseases such as AMD. The full report of the outcome of this analysis is available as a PDF in this repository.
